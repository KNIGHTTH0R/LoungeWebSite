== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* The plugin requires at least wp version 3.1.
* The theme should have a call to wp_head() in its header.php file and wp_footer() in its footer.php file.
* The theme should load enqueued scripts in the header if the scripts are enqueued without the $in_footer switch (like wppa.js and jQuery).
* The theme should not prevent this plugin from loading the jQuery library in its default wp manner, i.e. the library jQuery in safe mode (uses jQuery() and not $()).
* The theme should not use remove_action() or remove_all_actions() when it affects actions added by wppa+.
Most themes comply with these requirements.
However, check these requirements in case of problems with new installations with themes you never had used before with wppa+ or when you modifies your theme.
* The server should have at least 64MB of memory.

= Standard installation when not from the wp plugins page =
* Unzip and upload the wppa plugin folder to wp-content/plugins/
* Make sure that the folder wp-content/uploads/ exists and is writable by the server (CHMOD 755, some systems need CHMOD 777)
* Activate the plugin in WP Admin -> Plugins.
* If, after installation, you are unable to upload photos, check the existance and rights (CHMOD 755, some systems need CHMOD 777) of:
for the single site mode installation: the folders .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/ and .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/thumbs/,
and for the multisite mode installation (example for blog id 92): the folders path: .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/ and .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/thumbs/.
In rare cases you will need to create them manually. You can see the actual pathnames and urls in the lowest table of the Photo Albums -> Settings page.
* If you upgraded from WP Photo Album (without plus) and you had copied wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css
to your theme directory, you must remove them or replace them with the newly supplied versions. The fullsize will be reset to 640 px.
See Table I-A1 and Table I-B1,2 of the Photo Albums -> Settings admin page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do i have to do when converting to multisite? =

* If your WP installation is a new installation and you want to have only one - global - WPPA system, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_GLOBAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is a new installation and you want to have a separate WPPA system for each sub-site, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_INDIVIDUAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is older than 3.5 an you want to have only one - global - WPPA system, ad to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_GLOBAL', true );**
* If your WP installation is older than 3.5 an you want to have a separate WPPA system for each sub-site, add to wp-config.php:
**define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_BLOGSDIR', true );**
* If you want to convert your multisite WP installation that is prior to 3.5 to a version later than 3.5 and you want to convert an existing WPPA multisite installation
to the new multisite standards, do the following:
1. Update WP to version 3.5 or later.
1. Upate WPPA+ to version 5.4.7 or later.
1. Perform the network migration utility from the network admin which moves all the files from wp-content/blogs.dir/xx to wp-content/uploads/sites/xx
1. **Add** to wp-config.php: **define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_INDIVIDUAL', true );**
1. If it is there, **Remove** from wp-config.php: **define( 'WPPA_MULTISITE_BLOGSDIR', true );**

= Which other plugins do you recommand to use with WPPA+, and which not? =

* Recommanded plugins: qTranslate, WP Super Cache, Cube Points, Simple Cart & Buy Now, Google-Maps-GPX-Viewer.
* Plugins that break up WPPA+: My Live Signature.
* Google Analytics for WordPress will break the slideshow in most cases when *Track outbound clicks & downloads:* has been checked in its configuration.

= Which themes have problems with wppa+ ? =

* Photocrati has a problem with the wppa+ embedded lightbox when using page templates with sidebar.

= Are there special requirements for responsive (mobile) themes? =

* Yes! Go to the Photo Albums -> Settings admin page. Enter **auto** in Table I-A1. Lowercase letters, no quotes.
* Do not use size="[any number]", use size="0.80" for 80% with etc.
* If you use the Slideshow widget, set the width also to **auto**, and the vertical alignment to **fit**.
* You may also need to change the thumbnail sizes for widgets in *Table I-F 2,4,6 and 8*. Set to 75 if you want 3 columns in the theme *Responsive*.

= After update, many things seem to go wrong =

* After an update, always clear your browser cache (CTRL+F5) and clear your temp internetfiles, this will ensure the new versions of js files will be loaded.
* And - most important - if you use a server side caching program (like WP Total Cavhe) clear its cache.
* Make sure any minifying plugin (like W3 Total Cache) is also reset to make sure the new version files are used.
* Visit the Photo Albums -> Settings page -> Table VII-A1 and press Do it!
* When upload fails after an upgrade, one or more columns may be added to one of the db tables. In rare cases this may have been failed.
Unfortunately this is hard to determine.
If this happens, make sure (ask your hosting provider) that you have all the rights to modify db tables and run action Table VII-A1 again.

= How does the search widget work? =

* A space between words means AND, a comma between words means OR.
Example: search for 'one two, three four, five' gives a result when either 'one' AND 'two' appears in the same (combination of) name and description.
If it matches the name and description of an album, you get the album, and photo vice versa.
OR this might apply for ('three' AND 'four') OR 'five'.
If you use indexed search, the tokens must be at least 3 characters in length.

= How can i translate the plugin into my language? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=1349

= How do i install a hotfix? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=823

= What to do if i get errors during upload or import photos? =

* It is always the best to downsize your photos to the Full Size before uploading. It is the fastest and safest way to add photos tou your photo albums.
Photos that are way too large take unnessesary long time to download, so your visitors will expierience a slow website.
Therefor the photos should not be larger (in terms of pixelsizes) than the largest size you are going to display them on the screen.
WP-photo-album-plus is capable to downsize the photos for you, but very often this fails because of configuration problems.
Here is explained why:
Modern cameras produce photos of 7 megapixels or even more. To downsize the photos to either an automaticly downsized photo or
even a thumbnail image, the server has to create internally a fullsize fullcolor image of the photo you are uploading/importing.
This will require one byte of memory for each color (Red, Green, Blue) and for every pixel.
So, apart form the memory required for the server's program and the resized image, you will need 21 MB (or even more) of memory just for the intermediate image.
As most hosting providers do not allow you more than 64 MB, you will get 'Out of memory' errormessages when you try to upload large pictures.
You can configure WP to use 128 MB (That would be enough in most cases) by specifying *define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M');* in wp-config.php,
but, as explained earlier, this does not help when your hosting provider does not allows the use of that much memory.
If you have control over the server yourself: configure it to allow the use of enough memory.
Oh, just Google on 'picture resizer' and you will find a bunch of free programs that will easily perform the resizing task for you.

* New shortcode type: url. Example: [wppa type="url" photo="4711"][/wppa]. Returns the url to the highest resolution file to the photo with id=4711.
